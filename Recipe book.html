<h3><strong>How To Make Alale;</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, soak the beans in cold water until they are soft enough to pulse and sieve to remove the fine outer covering or peel.</li>
        <li>Then drain and pour the soaked beans into a processor that  would be used to grind or blend it until a fine paste is achieved.</li>
        <li> Starting to mix, add crayfish/sardines, beef, sliced boiled eggs, or a combination of these and other 'garnishes' to the paste to liven up the taste.</li>
        <li> Get a slanted pyramid-shaped cover, or a cylindrical shape, or cone shape or any of your targeted shape that would owe to the mold the paste is poured into prior to cooking.</li>
        <li>Add seasoned and garnished liquid into the cover and pour the paste.</li>
        <li> After packaging, place in a large pot about a tenth filled with water and arrnage, then close to allow the steam to be contained. </li>
        <li>Allow it to steam for like 45 minutes. If you notice that the water in the pot has dried up, carefully add more water.
        <li>Carefully remove the Alale from the pot, uncover and place into plates, then add spices and oil, and enjoy!.</li>
    <p><strong>PS:</strong>The process of making Alale can be made easy by grinding beans to flour also called Beans flour,<br>
        This will reduce stress of peeling beans and washing multiple times, and all that would be needed is to mix the bean flour with water, add seasonings and salt to taste, fish, stocks, pawns, etc.</p>
